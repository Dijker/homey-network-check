# Network Check

This app will make sure the internet connection is up and running.

Once a minute it will try to connect to an external site and use led ring to signal problems. You can use the trigger from a flow to extend the signal function yourself.

Update:
Since the previous version, speech usage has been removed so you need to do this from a flow if you need it. Led ring heartbeat has not been changed.
